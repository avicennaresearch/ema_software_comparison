# EMA Software Comparison
Ecological Momentary Assessment, or EMA, is a software widely used by
researchers in health research and pscyhology to collect real-world data from
participants. Researchers use EMA software to study humans throughout their
daily lives, rather than in a lab. So it's important for the software to be as
invisible as possible. It should get activated exactly when needed, ask a few
short questions, and disappear until next time.

At its core, EMAs are a very simple software: they prompt a notification to the
participant, ask them to complete a short survey, and then upload the data.
That's one reason there are so many of it. We are aware of 63!

But it's not easy to pick the right software. The main reason is, even though
the EMA software plays a deceiveingly simple role, if it fails, it can
jeoperdize the entire study. For example, if the software fails to notify
participants when it's time to answer a quick survey, no data will be collected
and the entire study is destroyed.

Another reason is EMAs, unlike business-focus softwares, require more
flexibility to conform to the study design. So often studies have quite a
few additional requirements aside from short surveys. This includes intervention
management, cognitive task features, tele-visit and communication features,
simplified enrollment, screening, consent, onboarding, and so on. At the same time,
the research often has limited budget to allocate to the software.

When you combine the above with the large number of available software, and their
poor to non-existent documentation of them, you will realize selecting an EMA software
is like marriage. You have to make a huge decision with very limited information,
and the consequence of that decision can even make or break your research career.

The purpose of this repository is gather as much information as possible about
software packages, and document pros and cons of each of them.
